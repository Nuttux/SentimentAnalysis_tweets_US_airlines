The specific problem we are going to solve is based on a twitter dataset including tweets about US airlines. It includes Twitter data that was scraped from February of 2015 and classified into positive, negative, and neutral, followed by a categorization of the negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").  Using this dataset we have to identify the sentiment of a given tweet (positive, negative, and neutral) based on its textual content. 

Details:
This is a multi-class classification task (the target variable to predict is airline_sentiment which can be [positive, negative or neutral])
We will apply SVM and Naive Bayes to solve the task. 
We will use R
